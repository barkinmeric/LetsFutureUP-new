Choosing the right sector/department before starting  the job, learning many issues that the student can learn in at least one year after starting the job, by hearing and seeing one-on-one from people who have spent years in this job and have had many experiences, will create very important opportunities in one’s career.

And this is precisely the responsibility of those who can and should share this wealth selflessly. In this way both sides are ennobled.

			"Before the beginning of 2020, If you asked what a pandemic is, we would definitely search at Google. It was not the situation we have experienced before.",
			"Now, we know that this was an outbreak that make people stay at their homes, construct social distance with other people and enforce them to embrace New World Order. While New World Order was mentioned during Pandemic, we intended to build this new order together and we took the road with the notion “Guiding to Future”.",
			"While people are trying to fit their lives into their home, exploring themselves and the environment during the Pandemic, they are feeling worried about not finding self-satisfying answers to question which is “Where is our existence in this process ?”. Spending whole time at homes, people understood the importance of such notions as personal growth, social responsibility and awareness. The whole world turned into their inside and thought of what type of changes they would love to make in their lives. People realized that they forgot finding themselves in their daily lives and they felt the significance of gaining their life experiences again.",
			"Therefore, in this pursuit, in order to be an answer for people, by inspiring from the quote of Mahatma Gandhi “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.”, we created Let’s FutureUP project for young people who care about their development and want to say hello to their future careers."

We’re trying to introduce the professional life to the students who are at the beginning of their career journey with the guidance of the names who gained experience in professional life for years. If you’d like to meet people who knows what is waiting for you in your career and also who wants to prepare you for them; we’d like to see you with us as our mentees. Furthermore, it is a fact that this project didn’t only established to advance and prepare students. With “Let’s FutureUP Mentorship Program” experienced names in the business life could find a chance to learn about the expectations and goals of the new generation. Moreover, they could discover a platform for finding their potential interns and co-workers. If you’d like to support the leaders of the future in their decisions and participate to build their opinions; we’d be grateful to see you with us in our social responsibility project Let’s FutureUP which includes trainings and mentorship programs as our mentors.Because, we’ve seen the effects of a person’s influence on other persons in the past years. We could understand the fact of how great is the need for this program with the precious feedbacks of our mentors and mentees. A better future is the common goal of all of us and working to actualize this future is our collective responsibility. We’re believing in the difference of only a grain of rice on the balance. That’s why we’re asking you to be a link in our chain which is reaching forward. With Let’s FutureUP; reach to the “future”!",
